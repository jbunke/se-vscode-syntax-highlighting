# DeltaScript for Stipple Effect - VS Code Syntax Highlighting Extension

This VS Code extension provides syntax highlighting for an extension flavour of my scripting language [*DeltaScript*](https://github.com/jbunke/delta-time/wiki/DeltaScript) for my pixel art editor [*Stipple Effect*](https://github.com/jbunke/stipple-effect).

If you are reading this on GitHub, you can download the latest version of the extension [here](https://github.com/jbunke/se-vscode-syntax-highlighting/releases/latest) or from the VS Code Extension Marketplace.
